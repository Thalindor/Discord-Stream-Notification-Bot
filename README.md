# Twitch Live Stream Notifier
A discord bot that you can use to receive live stream notifications from the streamers you want.

## How it works
Once running, the script will keep checking for your stream to go live and post in the Discord channel when it goes live with the message and description of your choosing, along with the box-art for the current activity.

Discord bot has 3 commands you can use.
