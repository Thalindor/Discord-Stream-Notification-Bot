# Twitch Live Stream Notifier
A discord bot that you can use to receive live stream notifications from the streamers you want.

## How it works
Once running, the script will keep checking for your stream to go live and post in the Discord channel when it goes live with the message and description of your choosing, along with the box-art for the current activity.

Discord bot has 3 commands you can use.

### /show-subscriptions
It shows you the list of broadcasters from whom you want to receive live broadcast notifications.

### /get-notification
You can receive live stream notifications from any streamer you want by entering the input with this command.

### /show-subscriptions
You can stop receiving live stream notification from the user you previously wanted to receive notifications from by entering the input using this command.
